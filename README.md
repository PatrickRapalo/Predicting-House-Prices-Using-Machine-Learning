# Predicting-House-Prices-Using-Machine-Learning
Using data analytic tools to predict the price of houses.

#### THE GOAL ####

The goal is to predict house prices based on features such as location, size, number of bedrooms, etc.

I will first use a Kaggle dataset, I might web scrape after I create a prediction model.

#### TOOLS ####

I will use python libraries such as pandas and seaborn for models and visualizations.

Could also use R for visualizations.
